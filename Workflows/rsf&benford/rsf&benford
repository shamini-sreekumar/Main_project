RSF 
-----

Relative size factor (RSF) is a test to identify anomalies where the largest amount for subsets in a given key is outside the norm for those subsets.
This test compares the top two amounts for each subset and calculates the RSF for each.
In order to identify potential fraudulent activities in invoice payment data, one utilizes the largest and the second-largest amounts 
to calculate a ratio based on purchases that are grouped by vendors.
