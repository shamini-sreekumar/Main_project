The Altman Z-score is a formula for determining whether a company, notably in the manufacturing space, is headed for bankruptcy. 
An Altman Z-score close to 1.8 suggests a company might be headed for bankruptcy, while a score closer to 3 suggests a company is in solid financial positioning.
a variation of the traditional z-score in statistics, is based on five financial ratios that can be calculated from data found on a company's annual 10-K report.
